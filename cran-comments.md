## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 4.0.2 Patched
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 73 downstream dependencies
(<https://github.com/ropensci/crul/blob/master/revdep/README.md>). No problems were found related to this package. A few packages failed during reverse dependency checks but when checked individually they had no problems (revdepcheck probably just failed on installation).

This version includes many improvements for the ok() function, adds a new R6 class, some functions gain parameters, and other improvements.

Thanks!
